Human
    States:
        Noticing things like that it is very stinky, or that it has been a while since they've cleaned, or that they are sick
        Going to bathroom
        Washing hands
        Cleaning germs
        Showering
        Something at computer
        Getting food
        Eating food
        Drinking drink
        Sleep (Will inevitably create stink germs)
        
Maybe everything from outside has hand germs on it?

When Hand and Stinky germ combine, they create a virus, maybe need two of each to make a virus?
When Human goes through a space that has hand germs or does something that involves their hands, they get hand germs on their hands
When Human stays in one spot for long enough or goes to the bathroom, they create stinky germ
When Human has a lot of bacteria on them, they become sick
If Human is sick for long enough, they die
